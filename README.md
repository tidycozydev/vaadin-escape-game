# Vaadin Escape Game

First contact with development for the last year and a half. Obviously, nothing crazy.

Vaadin has changed a lot since the last time I've used this framework.
This application/game was a funny way to relearn how to code with it.

## Project development

I have based this project on the Vaadin tutorial.

No data persistence nor testing were implemented for this very small-sized project.

Have fun with it: https://tidycozy.dev/vaadin-escape-game

## What's next?

I intend to implement statistics and some machine learning to improve the dogbot.

## Build the jar

From the tutorial README.md:

To create a production build, call `mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Windows),
or `./mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Mac & Linux).
